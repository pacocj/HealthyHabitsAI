# HealthyHabitsAI
Building AI course project

## Summary
HealthyHabitsAI is an AI system that helps people adopt healthy habits in their daily routines.

## Background
### Problem
With a busy lifestyle, many people forget to take care of their health throughout the day. Small reminders can make a big difference in adopting healthy habits.

### Motivation
The idea is to create a tool that encourages habit changes in a simple way, aiming for long-term improvements in well-being.

## How is it used?
### Usage Context
The user provides their routine and preferences, such as work hours and break times. The system then sends personalized reminders to maintain healthy habits.

## Data sources and AI methods
### Data
- User preferences: work hours, water intake, exercise frequency, and types of healthy habits to track.
- Data collected manually from initial responses provided by the user.

### AI Techniques
- Logistic regression to determine the frequency and type of reminder.
- Decision trees to categorize reminders based on user data.

## Challenges
- Limitation: Suggestions are generalized and based on basic preferences, without real-time data.
- Ethics: Maintaining the privacy of user data is essential.

## What next?
In the future, HealthyHabitsAI could be expanded to integrate data from wearable devices, enabling more personalized recommendations.

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the need to improve well-being during work and study routines.
